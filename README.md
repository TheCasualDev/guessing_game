# JACKS SUPER ORIGINAL GUESSING GAME üî¢ü¶Ä
This guessing game was created using the offical [Rust handbook üìô](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-invalid-input)


# How to install and run
There are two methods for running this app. You can either build it yourself or simply download the exe file from the site. 

## Building yourself
If you wish to build it yourself you will need to have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) you can find more info on building a rust project [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html#building-and-running-a-cargo-project).

## Running the exe
- To get started download the ``guessing_game-windows.exe`` from the [releases](https://github.com/TheCasualDev/guessing_game/releases/tag/v0.1.0) tab.
- Since this exe isnt signed both chrome and windows will try to stop you from downloading and running. Below are the steps to get past both blocks
	- for chrome simply on the **little arrow pointing right** & **click Continue Download**
	- for Windows defender simply click on **More info** followed with clicking on **Run anyway**
- and enjoy üëç

If you do have trust issues I would recommend going for the Building it yourself method
